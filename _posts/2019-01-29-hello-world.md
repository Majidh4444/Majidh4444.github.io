## MySelf:
  - I'am K Majidh
  - From Kuppam,chittor(dist),AndraPradesh
  - Joined Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham(Amrithapuri)
  - S1_EAC Branch

## Experience:
  I had no knowledge in the cs background till my class 12. By the tasks of amFoss club i had really explored in various fields of coding.
  
  At first by seeing the given tasks everything was new to me like github, hackerrank, etc..those stuff. But the club made us easy somewhat by providing data,links to the corresponding tasks and also by the discord server as mine 'mars' which are amazing, where alotted seniors are responding to our queries,douts and giving us a solution.

  By this up to now as much as i can i have completed some tasks they are:
   
   Task-0
   Task-1
   Task-2
   Task-4
   Task-9
   Task-13
   Task-14
